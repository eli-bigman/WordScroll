This is a React Native app that fetches a list of words from a word API and displays them in a scrollable list view. The app makes a request to the API to fetch the list of words and renders them in a user-friendly manner.

## Features

- Fetches data from the Datamuse API, which provides words that rhyme, sound like, or are related to a given word.
- Displays the words in a scrollable list view using the FlatList component.
- Handles errors and loading states gracefully.
